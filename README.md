## cazy_webscraper

`cazy_webscraper` is an application and Python3 package for the automated retrieval of protein data from the [CAZy](http://wwww.cazy.org/) database. The code is distributed under the MIT license.

**`cazy_webscraper` retrieves protein data from the [CAZy database](https://www.cazy.org) and stores the data in a local SQLite3 database.** This enables users to integrate the dataset into analytical pipelines, and interrogate the data in a manner unachievable through the CAZy website.

**Data can be retrieved for user defined datasets of interest.** `cazy_webscraper` can recover specified CAZy Classes and/or CAZy families. These queries can be filtered by taxonomy at Kingdoms, genus, species or strain level. Successive CAZy queries can be collated into a single local database. A log of each query is recorded in the database for transparency, reproducibility and shareablity.

**Using the `expand` subcommand, a user can expand the core dataset.** Specifically, `cazy_webscraper` can be used to retrieve data from the following external databases for CAZymes in the local CAZyme database that meet user specified criteria, and adds the downloaded data to the local CAZyme database:

**[GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/):**  
- Protein sequences 
- Latest taxonomic classification - including complete lineage (including phylum, class, order and family) (version >=2.1.2)
- Latest genomic assembly data (GenBank and RefSeq (when available) version accession and ID numbers) (version >=2.1.3)

**[UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/):**  
- Protein name
- UniProt accession
- EC numbers
- PDB accessions
- Protein sequences

**[Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/):**
- Protein structure files
- *Structure files are written to disk, **not** stored in the local CAZyme database*

**[Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB)](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/):**
Retrieve the latest archaeal and bacterial taxonomic classifications (including complete lineages from kingdom to species) - available in `cazy_webscraper` verion >= 2.2.0.

**`cazy_webscraper` faciltates extracting information from the local CAZyme database.**

Protein sequences (retrieved from GenBank and/or UniProt) from the local CAZyme database for CAZymes matching the user specified criteria, and write to:
- A single multisequence FASTA file
- A FASTA file per extracted protein sequence
- A local BLASTP database

**The `cazy_webscraper` API facilitates interoggating the local CAZyme database.**

Please see the [full documentation at ReadTheDocs](https://cazy-webscraper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

**The `bioconda` installation method is not currently supported, but we are working on getting this fixed soon**. For now please install via pypi or from source.

### Combining configuration filters

`cazy_webscraper` applies filters in a successive and layered structure.

CAZy class and family filters are applied first.

Kingdom filters are applied second.

Lastly, taxonomy (genus, species and strain) filters are applied.

### Default CAZy class synonyms

CAZy classes are accepted in the written long form (such as Glycoside Hydrolases) and in their abbreviated form (e.g. GH).

Both the plural and singular abbreviated form of a CAZy class name is accepted, e.g. GH and GHs.

Spaces, hythens, underscores and no space or extract character can be used in the CAZy class names. Therefore, Glycoside Hydrolases, Glycoside-Hydrolases, Glycoside_Hydrolases and GlycosideHydrolases are all accepted.

Class names can be written in all upper case, all lower case, or mixed case, such as GLYCOSIDE-HYDROLASES, glycoside hydrolases and Glycoside Hydrolases. All lower or all upper case CAZy class name abbreviations (such as GH and gh) are accepted.

## Retrieve data from UniProt

[UniProtKB] is one of the largest protein database, incorporating data from the [PDB] structure database, NCBI and other protein annotation databases.

`cazy_webscraper` can retrieve protein data from UniProt for proteins catalogued in a local CAZyme database created using `cazy_webscraper`. Specifically, for each protein, `cazy_webscraper` can retrieve:
- The UniProt accession
- Protein name
- PDB accessions of associated structure files from the PDB database
- EC number annnotations
- Protein sequence from the UniProt

`cazy_webscraper` always retrieves the UniProt accession and protein name, but the retrieval of PDB accession, EC numbers and protein sequences is optional.

Data can be retrieived for all proteins in the local CAZyme database, or a specific subset. CAZy class, CAZy family, genus, species, strains, kingdom and EC number filters can be defined in order to define a dataset to retrieve protein data for.

To retrieve all UniProt data for all proteins in a local CAZyme datbase, using the following command:
```bash
cw_get_uniprot_data <path_to_local_CAZyme_db> <user_email> --ec --pdb --sequence
```

### UniProt data retrieval cache

- The tables retrieved from UniProt are converted to dataframes, and written out as CSV files in the cache directory
- The parsed UniProt data as a single JSON file

## Retrieveing protein seqences from GenBank

Protein amino acid sequences can be retrieved for proteins in a local CAZyme database using `cazy_webscraper`. Protein sequences can be retrieved for a specific subset of proteins, identified through the use of CAZy class, CAZy family, taxonomy (kingdom, genus, species and strain) filters, and EC number filters. The retrieved protein sequences are written to the local CAZyme database.

_Extracting protein sequences from the local CAZyme database and writing them to a BLAST database and/or FASTA file(s) is covered in the next section._

To retrieve all GenBank protein seuqneces for all proteins in a local CAZyme datbase, using the following command:
```bash
cw_get_genbank_seqs <path_to_local_CAZyme_db>
```

### GenBank sequence retrieval cache

`cazy_webscraper` produces three cache files, which are written to the cache dir:
1. `no_seq_retrieved.txt` which lists the GenBank accessions for which no sequence could be retrieved from GenBank
2. `seq_retrieved.txt` which list GenBank accessiosn for which a sequence was retrieved from GenBank
3. JSON file keyed by GenBank accessions and valued by the retrieved protein sequence

## Extracting protein sequences from the local CAZyme database and building a BLAST database

Protein sequences from GenBank and UniProt that are stored in the local CAZyme database can be extracted using `cazy_webscraper`, and written to any combination of:
- 1 FASTA file per unique protein
- A single FASTA file containing all extracted seqences
- A BLAST database

**FASTA file format:** Protein sequences extracted from a local CAZyme database are written out with the GenBank/UniProt accession as the protein ID, and the name of the source database ('GenBank' or 'UniProt') as the description.

To extract all protein seqeunces from the local CAZyme database using the following command structure:
```bash
cw_extract_db_seqs <path_to_local_CAZyme_db> genbank uniprot
```

To retrieve protein sequences from GenBank or UniProt, name only the respective database. For example, to retrieve only 
GenBank proteins:
```bash
cw_extract_db_seqs <path_to_local_CAZyme_db> genbank
```


### Configuring extracting sequences from a local CAZyme db

Below are listed the command-line flags for configuring the extraction of protein sequences from the local CAZyme db.

`database` - \[REQUIRED\] Path to a local CAZyme database to add UniProt data to.

`source` - \[REQUIRED\] Define source databases of protein sequences. Accepts 'genbank' and 'uniprot'. To list both, separate with a single space (' ')
```bash
cw_extract_sequence cazy_database.db genbank uniprot
```
*The database names are not case sensitive, therefore, both GenBank and genbank are accepted.* 

`-b`, `--blastdb` - Create BLAST database of extracted protein sequences. Provide the path to the directory to store the BLAST database in.

`--fasta_dir` - Write out each extracted sequence to a separate FASTA file in the provided dir. Provide a path to a directory to write out the FASTA files.

## Retrieving protein structure files from PDB

`cazy_webscraper` can retrieve protein structure files for proteins catalogued in a local CAZyme database. Structure files can be retrieved for all proteins in the database or a subset of proteins, chosen by defining CAZy class, CAZy family, taxonomy (kingdom, genus, species and strain) filters, and EC number filters.

Retrieval of structure files from PDB is performed by the `BioPython` module `PDB` [Cock _et al._, 2009], which writes the downloaded structure files to the local disk. Therefore, the downloaded structure files are **not** stored in the local CAZyme database at the present.

> Cock, P. J. A, Antao, T., Chang, J. T., Chapman, B. A., Cox, C. J., Dalke, A. _et al._ (2009) 'Biopython: freely available Python tools for computaitonal molecular biology and bioinformatics', _Bioinformatics_, 25(11), pp. 1422-3.

To retrieve structure files for all proteins in a local CAZyme database in `mmCif` and `pdb` format, use the following command:
```bash
cw_get_pdb_structures <path_to_local_CAZyme_db> mmcif,pdb
```

Protein structure files can be retrieved in a variety of formats, including:

- mmCif (default, PDBx/mmCif file),
- pdb (format PDB),
- xml (PDBML/XML format),
- mmtf (highly compressed),
- bundle (PDB formatted archive for large structure}

## Retrieving NCBI taxonomies

Taxonomic opinions frequently change, and CAZy can fall out of sync with the latest taxonomic classifications with NCBI. To maintain an updated CAZyme database, `cazy_webscraper` can be used to retrieve the latest taxonomic classifications from NCBI for CAZymes in a local CAZyme database that meet the user's specified criteria. The downloaded taxonomic data is added to the local CAZyme database.

The complete lineage data is retrieved from NCBI. Whereas CAZy lists only the kingdom, genus, species and strain, `cazy_webscraper` retrieves the full taxonomic lineage from NCBI and stores the complete lineage in the `NcbiTaxs` table in the local CAZyme database. This include:
- Kingdom
- Phylum
- Class (stored as `tax_class` in the local CAZyme database due to keyword classes in Python)
- Order(stored as `tax_order` in the local CAZyme database due to keyword classes in SQL)
- Family
- Genus
- Species
- Strain

The command for retrieving the latest taxonomic classifications from the NCBI Taxonomy database using `cazy_webscraper` is `cw_get_ncbi_taxs`.

## Retrieving GTDB Taxonomies

`cazy_webscraper` can be used to retrieve the latest taxonomic classification from the [Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB)](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) taxonomy database for a set of proteins of interest in a local CAZyme database.

**Note:**
    As in the GTDB database, GTDB taxonomic classifications are retrieved and associated with genomes stored 
    in the local CAZyme database. To retrieve GTDB taxonomic classifications the genomic data for the 
    proteins of interest **must** be listed in the local CAZyme database.

GTDB catalogues archaeal and bacterial lineages. Either archaeal and/or bacterial GTDB lineages can be added to the local CAZyme database.

The complete lineage data is retrieved from GTDB. Whereas CAZy lists only the kingdom, genus, species and strain, `cazy_webscraper` retrieves the full taxonomic lineage from GTDB and stores the complete lineage in the `GtdbTaxs` table in the local CAZyme database. This include:
- Kingdom
- Phylum
- Class (stored as `tax_class` in the local CAZyme database due to keyword classes in Python)
- Order(stored as `tax_order` in the local CAZyme database due to keyword classes in SQL)
- Family
- Genus
- Species
- Strain
- Release (the GTDB release from which the lineage was retrieved)

The command for retrieving the latest taxonomic classifications from the NCBI Taxonomy database using `cazy_webscraper` is `cw_get_gtdb_taxs`.

### Configuring retrieving GTDB taxonomies


`database` - **REQUIRED** Path to a local CAZyme database to add UniProt data to.

## The `cazy_webscraper` API or Interrogating the local CAZyme database

The SQLite3 database compiled by `cazy_webscraper` can be interrogated in the native interface (i.e. queries written in SQL can be used to interrogate the database). This can be achieved via the command-line or via an SQL database browser (such as [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)).

`cazy_webscraper` also provides its own API (Application Programming Interface) for interrogating the local CAZyme database: `cw_query_database`. The API faciliates the intergration of the dataset in the local CAZyme database into downstream bioinformatic pipelines, _and_ provides a method of interrograting the dataset for those who do not use SQL.

`cw_query_database` is the command that can be used to interrogate the dataset in the local CAZyme database, and extract protein data of interest for the proteins matching the user's cirteria of 
interest.

By default `cw_query_database` retrieves only the GenBank accessions of proteins matching the user's criteria of interest. If not criteria of interest are provided, all GenBank accessions are retrieved. Optional flags can be applied to retrieve additional data about CAZymes that match the user's criteria of interest.

`cw_query_database` currently supports writing the output in two file formats:
- `json`, by default this is written to the current working directory and with name `<database_name>_<retrieved_data>_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json`
- `csv`, by default this is written to the current working directory and with name `<database_name>_<retrieved_data>_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.csv`

`cw_query_database` takes two positional arguments:
1. The path to the local CAZyme database
2. The file formats of the output files, presented as a list with each file type separated by as single comma (e.g. `json,csv`). This is **not** case sensitive and the order does **not** matter.
For example, to retrieve all GenBank accessions for all proteins in the local CAZyme database, and 
write them to a `json` file, the following command could be used for a database called `cazy.db`:
```bash
cw_query_database cazy.db json
```

By default the output is written to the current working directory. A specific output directory (which can be built by `cazy_webscraper`) can be defined using the `-o`/`--output_dir` flag, followed by the path of the desired output directory.

The file names of all output files are composed of the name of the local CAZyme database, followed by the names of the data retrieved from the local CAZyme database. For example, retrieving the following data from the local CAZyme database called `cazy_database.db`:
- CAZy family annotation
- CAZy subfamily annotations
- EC numbers
- PDB accessions
Will produce the following file name: `cazy_database_gbkAcc_fams_subfams_ec_pdb`.  

An optional prefix can be applied to all output file names using the `-p`/`--prefix` flag, followed by the desired prefix. For example, using the same example as above, the prefix 'engineering_candidates_` can be applied to every output file by adding the following to command:
```bash
--prefix engineering_candidates_
```
This will produce output files with the file name `engineering_candidates_cazy_database_gbkAcc_fams_subfams_ec_pdb`.

`_gbkAcc` is always included in the file name because GenBank accessions are always retrieved and written to the output by cthe api.

The data retrieved from the local CAZyme database and included in the final output is defined using the `--include` flag, followed by a list of all data to *include* in the output, with each data separated with a single space.

### Configuring interrogating the local CAZyme database

Below are listed the command-line flags for configuring the interrogation of the local CAZyme database.

`database` - \[REQUIRED\] Path to a local CAZyme database to add UniProt data to.

`--sql_echo` - Set SQLite engine echo parameter to True, causing SQLite to print log messages. Default: False.

`--species` - List of species written as (Genus Species) to restrict the retrieval of CAZymes to. CAZymes will be retrieved for **all** strains of each given species.

`--strains` - List of specific species strains to restrict the retrieval of CAZymes to.

`--verbose`, `-v` - Enable verbose logging. This does not set the SQLite engine `echo` parameter to True. Default: False.


## Configuring `cazy_webscraper` using a YAML file

The retrieval of data from CAZy, UniProt, GenBank and PDB can be configured at the command-line **and** via a YAML file.

The YAML file must have the following structure, specifically the YAML file must have the exact keys presented below and the values can be customised to configure the behaviour of `cazy_webscraper`:
```yaml
classes:  # classes from which all proteins will be retrieved
  - "GH"
  - "CE"
Glycoside Hydrolases (GHs):
GlycosylTransferases (GTs):
Polysaccharide Lyases (PLs):
  - "GT1"
  - "GT5"
  - "GT6"
Carbohydrate Esterases (CEs):
Auxiliary Activities (AAs):
Carbohydrate-Binding Modules (CBMs):
genera:  # list genera to be scraped
 - "Trichoderma"
 - "Aspergillus"
species:  # list species, this will scrape all strains under the species
- "Pythium ultimum"
strains:  # list specific strains to be scraped
kingdoms:  # Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota, Viruses, Unclassified
```

For configuring the retrieval of data from UniProt, GenBank and PDB (_but not CAZy) the additional `ec` tag can be included to limit the retrieval of data to proteins annotated with specific EC numbers.

When listing EC numbers, the 'EC' prefix can be included or excluded. For example, 'EC1.2.3.4' and '1.2.3.4' are accepted. Additionally, both dashes ('-') and astrixes ('*') can be used to represent missing digits, both '1.2.3.-' and '1.2.3.\*' are accepted.

`cazy_webscraper` performs a direct EC number comparison. Therefore, supplying `cazy_webscraper` with the EC number EC1.2.3.- will only retrieve protein specifically annotated with EC1.2.3.-. `cazy_webscraper` will **not** retrieve proteins will all completed EC numbers under EC1.2.3.-, thus, `cazy_webscraper` will **not** retrieve data for proteins annotated with EC1.2.3.1, EC1.2.3.2, EC1.2.3.3, etc.

Example configuration files, and an empty configuraiton file template are located in the [`config_files`]() directory of this repo.


## Integrating a local CAZyme database

`cazy_webscraper` compiles data downloaded from external databases into a local SQLite3 database.

To facilitate integratting the local CAZyme database into third-party `Python` applications, use the `get_db_connection` function from `cazy_webscraper`, which will return an open connection to the CAZyme database from `sqlalchemy`.

`get_db_connection` takes 2 required args and one optional arg:  
**Required:**  
- Path to the local CAZyme database (provided as a `pathlib.Path` object)
- Bool to set the `sqlalchemy.create_engine` param `sql_echo`. When set to `True`, the SQL log will be printed to the terminal
**Optional:** 
- Bool to reflect if a new database. Default is `False`, i.e. connecting to an existing local CAZyme database

Import the function into the `Python` script using:
```python
from cazy_webscraper.sql.sql_orm import get_db_connection
```
