Retrieving Structures from PDB
==============================

The CAZy webscraper supports the automated retrieval of 3D structures from PDB for the scraped CAZymes. 
This is performed by using the ``bioservices.pdb`` module.

For specific information of the ``bioservices.pdb`` module please see the [bioservices documentation](https://bioservices.readthedocs.io/en/master/_modules/bioservices/pdb.html).
